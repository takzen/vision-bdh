This project is a PyTorch-based research framework dedicated to adapting and exploring the novel **Baby Dragon Hatchling (BDH)** architecture for computer vision tasks.

The original BDH architecture was proposed for language modeling in:
**"The Dragon Hatchling: The Missing Link between the Transformer and Models of the Brain"**  
*Adrian Kosowski, Przemysław Uznański, Jan Chorowski, Zuzanna Stamirowska, Michał Bartoszkiewicz*  
**[arXiv:2509.26507](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26507)**

Our goal is to investigate whether the unique, bio-inspired, and efficiency-oriented features of BDH can offer advantages in image analysis.

## What is Vision-BDH?

`Vision-BDH` is not just another Vision Transformer (ViT). It's a hybrid architecture combining:

*   **ViT's "body":** Patch-based image processing as a sequence
*   **BDH's "soul":** Unique recurrent computational core with bio-inspired features

### Unique BDH Features Preserved

Our model preserves 4 out of 5 fundamental innovations from the original BDH architecture:

| Key BDH Feature | Preserved? | Description |
|:----------------|:-----------|:------------|
| **Shared Parameters** | ✅ Yes | Single "layer" reused multiple times (recurrent depth) |
| **Sparse Activations (ReLU)** | ✅ Yes | Sparse, non-negative representations mimicking neural activity |
| **Constrained Attention (Q=K)** | ✅ Yes | Simplified attention based on activation similarity |
| **Multiplicative Gating** | ✅ Yes | Gating mechanism instead of standard residuals |
| Byte-Level Processing | ❌ No (Adapted) | Replaced with patch embeddings for visual data |

### Key Modifications for Vision

1. **Bidirectional Attention:** Removed causal masking to analyze all image patches simultaneously
2. **Enhanced v2 Architecture:** Xavier initialization, Pre-LayerNorm, and raw attention scores (no softmax)

---

## Experimental Results

We conducted controlled experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, training all models from scratch for **50 epochs** under identical conditions.

### CIFAR-10 Benchmark

| Model | Parameters | Test Accuracy | Notes |
|:------|:----------:|:-------------:|:------|
| **Vision-BDH v2 (optimized)** | **3.2M** | **81.73%** 🏆 | No softmax |
| Vision-BDH v2 (baseline) | 3.2M | 80.45% | With softmax |
| Vision-BDH v1 | 3.6M | 80.43% | Original |
| ViT-Tiny | 5.4M | 76.05% | Baseline |

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ **+5.68pp advantage** over ViT-Tiny with optimized v2
- ✅ **+1.28pp improvement** by removing softmax (81.73% vs 80.45%)
- ✅ **~40% fewer parameters** (3.2M vs 5.4M)
- ✅ **Q=K constraint provides natural normalization** - softmax is unnecessary

### CIFAR-100 Benchmark (Extended Comparison)

| Model | Parameters | Test Accuracy |
|:------|:----------:|:-------------:|
| **Vision-BDH v2** | **3.2M** | **51.44%** 🏆 |
| ViT-Tiny | 5.7M | 46.53% |
| ResNet-20 | 0.27M | 45.62% |
| EfficientNet-B0 | 4.1M | 40.20% |
| DeiT-Tiny | 5.5M | 35.31% |
| MobileNetV2 | 2.3M | 33.83% |

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ **Dominant performance** across all baselines
- ✅ **+4.91pp advantage** over ViT-Tiny (next best)
- ✅ **Efficient learner:** Outperforms "data-hungry" models in limited-epoch regime
- ✅ **Growing advantage:** Performance gap increases with task complexity

### Overall Conclusion

**Vision-BDH demonstrates superior accuracy and parameter efficiency 
compared to standard baselines. Key discoveries: Pre-LayerNorm enables 
+1.30pp improvement, and works synergistically with raw attention scores. 
Adding softmax to Pre-LN architecture negates most benefits.**

---

## Key Discovery: Raw Attention Scores

A critical finding in our research was that **removing softmax normalization** from the attention mechanism yielded significant improvement:

**Impact of Softmax:**
```
v2 with softmax:    80.45%
v2 without softmax: 81.73%
Improvement:        +1.28pp
```

**Why does this work?**

In standard Transformers, softmax is necessary because Q ≠ K:
```python
scores = Q @ K.T  # Different matrices
scores = softmax(scores / sqrt(d))  # Need normalization
```

In Vision-BDH, the **Q=K constraint** creates a self-similarity matrix:
```python
scores = Q @ Q.T  # Self-similarity matrix
# Already has desirable properties:
# - Diagonal dominance (self-attention)
# - Symmetric (bidirectional)
# - Bounded by RoPE encoding
```

The self-similarity matrix provides **natural normalization** without requiring softmax, allowing raw attention scores to be more expressive while maintaining training stability.

## Visual Analysis: How the Models "See"

To gain a deeper understanding of *why* `Vision-BDH` outperforms the baseline, we visualized the internal attention mechanism of both models. We analyzed the attention patterns from the center image patch to all other patches across different layers.

The results reveal fundamental differences in their processing strategies.

### Case Study 1: "Ship" Image

**Vision-BDH v2:**
![Vision-BDH Attention on a Ship](attention_maps/attention_vision-bdh_v2_ship.png)

*   **Analysis:** The `Vision-BDH` model demonstrates a highly logical and interpretable thought process. In the first layer, it immediately identifies a key anchor point (the bow of the ship). By the middle layer, it expands its focus to the entire horizontal structure of the hull, a pattern that is refined in the final layer. This shows an efficient strategy of identifying and focusing on the object's core structure early on.

**ViT-Tiny (Baseline):**
![ViT-Tiny Attention on a Ship](attention_maps/attention_vit-tiny_ship.png)

*   **Analysis:** In contrast, `ViT-Tiny` exhibits a more exploratory and less focused strategy. Its attention remains diffuse through the middle layers, suggesting a phase of broad context gathering. In the final layer, the attention almost completely dissipates, which may indicate that the necessary information has already been aggregated by the `[CLS]` token, making inter-patch attention less critical at the end.

### Case Study 2: "Bird" Image

**Vision-BDH v2:**
![Vision-BDH Attention on a Bird](attention_maps/attention_vision-bdh_v2_bird.png)

*   **Analysis:** The pattern is remarkably consistent. `Vision-BDH` again starts by locking onto a high-contrast anchor point (the bird's head/beak). It then progressively expands its attention to encompass the bird's main body, demonstrating a robust object-centric focus.

**ViT-Tiny (Baseline):**
![ViT-Tiny Attention on a Bird](attention_maps/attention_vit-tiny_bird.png)

*   **Analysis:** `ViT-Tiny` again shows a diffuse, exploratory pattern in its middle layers. Interestingly, its final attention focuses sharply on the background (foliage in the top-right corner) rather than the bird itself. This suggests it may be learning contextual associations (e.g., "foliage is often near birds") rather than focusing directly on the object's features—a potentially less robust strategy.

### Key Insights from Visualizations

*   🧠 **Two Different "Minds":** The models employ fundamentally different strategies. `Vision-BDH` is **decisive and object-centric**, quickly identifying and focusing on the subject. `ViT-Tiny` is more **exploratory and contextual**, spending more layers gathering broad information before making a final, sometimes indirect, association.

*   🚀 **Efficiency Explains Performance:** The highly efficient and interpretable attention strategy of `Vision-BDH` is a likely explanation for its superior performance. By avoiding a lengthy exploration phase and focusing on relevant object features early, it appears to learn more effectively within a limited training budget.

## Architecture Ablation Study

We systematically evaluated the impact of normalization strategy and attention design:

### Complete Results

| Variant | Normalization | Softmax? | Test Accuracy | Delta vs v1 |
|---------|---------------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| v1 (original) | Mixed LN | ❌ No | 80.43% | baseline |
| v2 baseline | Pre-LN | ✅ Yes | 80.45% | +0.02pp |
| **v2 optimized** | **Pre-LN** | ❌ **No** | **81.73%** 🏆 | **+1.30pp** |
| v3 (failed) | Pre-LN + ScaledLN | ❌ No | 77.27% | -3.16pp |

### Key Findings

#### 1. Pre-LayerNorm Enables the Improvement (+1.30pp)

**Comparison:**
```
v1 (Mixed LN, no softmax):  80.43%
v2 (Pre-LN, no softmax):    81.73%
Improvement:                +1.30pp
```

Pre-LayerNorm (normalizing before sub-layers rather than after) significantly improves performance. This is now the standard in modern Transformers (GPT-2+, T5, etc.) due to better gradient flow and training stability.

#### 2. Softmax Conflicts with Pre-LayerNorm Architecture

**Synergy Test:**
```
Pre-LN + no softmax:  81.73% ✅ (best)
Pre-LN + softmax:     80.45% ❌ (loses +1.28pp!)
```

Adding softmax to the Pre-LN architecture **negates most of the Pre-LN benefit**, resulting in only +0.02pp improvement over v1.

**Hypothesis:** Pre-LayerNorm stabilizes training, allowing raw attention scores (leveraging Q=K constraint) to be more expressive. Softmax normalization in this context may be overly restrictive, limiting the model's ability to learn nuanced attention patterns.

#### 3. Synergistic Architecture Design

The combination of Pre-LN and raw attention (no softmax) works synergistically:
- **Pre-LN alone:** Would need softmax for stability (standard Transformer)
- **No softmax alone (v1):** Limited by mixed normalization (80.43%)
- **Pre-LN + no softmax:** Achieves best results (81.73%) ✅

This suggests that architectural components should be co-designed rather than mixed arbitrarily. The Q=K constraint's natural normalization properties only shine when combined with proper normalization placement (Pre-LN).

## Architecture Evolution

| Feature | v1 (original) | v2 (baseline) | v2 (optimized) |
|---------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Parameters** | 3.6M | 3.2M | **3.2M** ✅ |
| **CIFAR-10 (50ep)** | 80.43% | 80.45% | **81.73%** 🏆 |
| **CIFAR-100 (50ep)** | - | **51.44%** 🏆 | - |
| Weight Init | Normal | **Xavier** | **Xavier** ✅ |
| LayerNorm | Mixed (Post-LN style) | **Pre-LN** | **Pre-LN** ✅ |
| Attention | **Raw scores** | With softmax | **Raw scores** ✅ |
| **Key Innovation** | Q=K constraint | Pre-LN | **Pre-LN + raw attention** 🎯 |
| **Recommendation** | Historical | Baseline | **Use this!** ✅ |

### Evolution Summary

**v1 → v2 baseline (+0.02pp):**
- Added Pre-LayerNorm ✅
- Added softmax ❌
- Net effect: Minimal improvement (softmax cancels Pre-LN benefit)

**v1 → v2 optimized (+1.30pp):**
- Added Pre-LayerNorm ✅
- Kept raw attention ✅
- Net effect: Significant improvement (synergy!)

**v2 baseline → v2 optimized (+1.28pp):**
- Removed softmax ✅
- Unlocked Pre-LN's full potential

---

## Key Discovery: Pre-LN + Raw Attention Synergy

### The Synergistic Effect

Our research revealed that **Pre-LayerNorm and raw attention scores work synergistically**, not independently:

```python
# v1: Mixed normalization + raw attention
for level in range(n_layer):
    x_latent = x @ encoder  # No pre-normalization
    # ... attention ...
    x = ln(x + y)  # Post-normalization
Result: 80.43%

# v2 baseline: Pre-LN + softmax
for level in range(n_layer):
    x = ln(x)  # Pre-normalization ✅
    x_latent = x @ encoder
    # ... attention with softmax ❌ ...
    x = x + y
Result: 80.45% (softmax limits Pre-LN benefit)

# v2 optimized: Pre-LN + raw attention
for level in range(n_layer):
    x = ln(x)  # Pre-normalization ✅
    x_latent = x @ encoder
    # ... raw attention (no softmax) ✅ ...
    x = x + y
Result: 81.73% (full synergy!)
```

### Why Does This Work?

**Pre-LayerNorm provides:**
- ✅ Stable gradient flow
- ✅ Normalized inputs to attention
- ✅ Better training dynamics

**Raw attention (Q=K constraint) provides:**
- ✅ Self-similarity matrix with natural properties
- ✅ Diagonal dominance (self-attention)
- ✅ Bounded by RoPE encoding

**When combined:**
- Pre-LN stabilizes training → raw scores can be more expressive
- Q=K constraint → natural normalization → softmax becomes redundant
- Result: Best of both worlds! 🎯

### Comparison with Standard Transformers

| Architecture | Pre-LN? | Softmax? | Why? |
|--------------|---------|----------|------|
| Standard Transformer | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Q ≠ K requires softmax normalization |
| Vision-BDH (optimized) | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Q = K provides natural normalization |

**Key insight:** The Q=K constraint fundamentally changes attention mechanics, making softmax unnecessary when combined with Pre-LN.

## Architecture Evolution

| Feature | Vision-BDH v1 | Vision-BDH v2 (baseline) | Vision-BDH v2 (optimized) |
|---------|---------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Parameters** | 3.6M | 3.2M | **3.2M** ✅ |
| **CIFAR-10 (50ep)** | 80.43% | 80.45% | **81.73%** 🏆 |
| **CIFAR-100 (50ep)** | - | **51.44%** 🏆 | - |
| Weight Init | Normal | **Xavier uniform** | **Xavier uniform** ✅ |
| LayerNorm | Post-encoder | **Pre-LN** | **Pre-LN** ✅ |
| Attention | **Raw scores** | With softmax | **Raw scores** ✅ |
| **Recommendation** | Historical | Good baseline | **Best performance** ✅ |

**Key Finding:** The optimized v2 removes softmax from attention, leveraging the Q=K constraint's natural normalization for +1.28pp improvement.

---

## Failed Experiments

### Vision-BDH v3: ScaledLayerNorm (77.27%)

**Hypothesis:** Depth-dependent scaling (1/sqrt(depth)) would improve gradient flow in deep recurrent networks, inspired by ReZero (Bachlechner et al., 2020).

**Implementation:**
```python
class ScaledLayerNorm(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, normalized_shape, depth_idx: int):
        super().__init__()
        self.ln = nn.LayerNorm(normalized_shape)
        self.scale = 1.0 / math.sqrt(depth_idx)  # Layer 6: 0.408×
```

**Result:** FAILED - accuracy dropped to 77.27% (-4.46pp vs v2 optimized).

**Analysis:**
- ❌ 6 layers is too shallow to need depth scaling
- ❌ 1/sqrt(depth) was too aggressive (layer 6: only 0.408× scaling)
- ❌ Over-damped deep layers, hindering learning
- ❌ Gradient accumulation: 0.408^6 ≈ 0.005 (severe vanishing)

**Lesson Learned:** Not all techniques from very deep networks (50+ layers) transfer to shallow networks (6 layers). **Simplicity wins** - removing softmax (+1.28pp) was more effective than adding complexity (-4.46pp).
